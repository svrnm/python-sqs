# Python with correlation over SQS

To run the project rename the [agent.stub.cfg](agent.stub.cfg) to `agent.cfg` and the [loop.stub.cfg](loop.stub.cfg) to `loop.cfg` and
set your controller properties.

Also, configure [boto3](https://github.com/boto/boto3) following the [quickstart](https://github.com/boto/boto3#quick-start), i.e. setup the credentials and config file.

Next, install the files in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

```
